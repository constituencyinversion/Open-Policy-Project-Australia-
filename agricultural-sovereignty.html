      <h2>Agricultural Sovereignty & Fair Trade Bill</h2>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure Australian farmers are protected, fairly compensated, and empowered to compete in domestic and export markets without being undercut by imports that do not meet Australian health, safety, and environmental standards.</p>
      
      <h3>Core Provisions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Domestic First Procurement:</strong> Government programs, schools, hospitals, and public institutions must prioritize locally produced food when quality and price are comparable. At least 70% local content is required for procurement contracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fair Competition Standards:</strong> Imports must meet identical health, safety, and environmental standards. A certification and labelling system ensures transparency. Penalties apply for non-compliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Farmer Support & Incentives:</strong> Queensland Farmer Resilience Fund for drought, flood, pest outbreaks, and market shocks. Low-interest loans, grants, and technical support for sustainable practices. Support for farm-to-market logistics and infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Export & Trade Empowerment:</strong> Incentives for competitive exports, trade missions, marketing campaigns, and a State Agri-Quality Seal for premium produce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Transparency & Market Monitoring:</strong> Public registry of domestic and imported goods including country of origin, production standards, and inspection outcomes. Regular market analysis to identify pricing or quality gaps.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Level the playing field for producers, protect local jobs and communities, promote sustainability and quality, and prevent unfair market practices from undermining local agriculture.</p>
