# HERO IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

## Your Hero Image

The site is configured to display your "Open Policy Project Australia" image as the hero background.

## To Add Your Image:

1. **Rename your image file to:** `hero-image.jpg`
   - Can also be: `hero-image.png` or `hero-image.webp`
   - Just update the filename in style.css if using different format

2. **Upload to repository root** (same folder as index.html)

3. **Commit the change**

4. **Site will auto-update in 1-2 minutes**

## Image Specifications:

- **Format:** JPG (recommended), PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended size:** 1920x1080px or larger
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 or wider
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Content:** Your Australia map with network connections image works perfectly

## Current Configuration:

The CSS is set to:
```css
background-image: url('hero-image.jpg');
background-size: cover;
background-position: center;
```

With a blue gradient overlay for text readability.

## If Image Doesn't Display:

1. Check filename matches exactly: `hero-image.jpg`
2. Check file is in root directory (not in /bills folder)
3. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild

## Optional: Use Different Filename

If you want to keep your original filename:

1. In `style.css`, find line 58:
   ```css
   background-image: url('hero-image.jpg');
   ```

2. Change to your filename:
   ```css
   background-image: url('unnamed2.jpg');
   ```

3. Commit both the image and the CSS change

Your image with the Australia map and "OPEN POLICY PROJECT AUSTRALIA" text will look great as the hero background!
