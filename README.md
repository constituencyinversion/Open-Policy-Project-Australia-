# Open Policy Project Australia

**Democratic policy infrastructure for all Australians**

## What This Is

Open Policy Project Australia is a platform for developing Australian legislation through transparent, public collaboration. 

Instead of policy flowing from lobby groups → politicians → public, it flows from people living in problem spaces → open collaboration → politicians who choose based on merit.

**No institutional funding. No political affiliation. No hidden processes.**

## How Comments and Reactions Work

### GitHub Discussions = Public Comment System

Each bill has a **GitHub Discussion thread** where anyone can:

### 💬 Comment
- Suggest specific changes
- Ask clarifying questions
- Identify unintended consequences
- Propose alternative approaches
- Share relevant expertise

### 👍 React
Use emoji reactions to signal support or concern:
- 👍 **Thumbs up** - I support this / good suggestion
- 👎 **Thumbs down** - I have concerns about this
- ❤️ **Heart** - This is important / priority issue
- 🎉 **Party** - Excellent improvement
- 🚀 **Rocket** - This should be implemented quickly
- 👀 **Eyes** - I'm watching this / interested

**Most-upvoted comments get priority consideration in bill revisions.**

### Why This System Works

1. **Transparent:** Every comment public and permanent
2. **Democratic:** Anyone can participate
3. **Efficient:** Reactions let you signal agreement without duplicate comments
4. **Trackable:** See how bills evolve based on feedback
5. **No Gatekeeping:** Can't be controlled by institutions

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
Only well-funded institutions can draft legislation that politicians will consider. This creates structural bias: policy reflects who can afford to draft it, not what would solve problems.

### The Solution
Democratize policy capacity. If you understand a problem—because you live with it—you can draft a solution. No credentials required. No institutional backing needed.

### The Result
Politicians get access to high-quality, non-captured policy alternatives. The institutional monopoly weakens. They can choose based on merit, not obligation.

**This is democratic infrastructure. Use it. Fork it. Build on it.**
