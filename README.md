# Open Policy Project Australia

## What This Is

Open Policy Project Australia is a platform for developing Australian legislation through transparent, public collaboration. 

Instead of policy flowing from lobby groups → politicians → public, it flows from people living in problem spaces → open collaboration → politicians who choose based on merit.

**No institutional funding. No political affiliation. No hidden processes.**

- 🚀 **Rocket** - This should be implemented quickly
- 👀 **Eyes** - I'm watching this / interested

**Most-upvoted comments get priority consideration in bill revisions.**

### Why This System Works

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
Only well-funded institutions can draft legislation that politicians will consider. This creates structural bias: policy reflects who can afford to draft it, not what would solve problems.

### The Solution
Democratize policy capacity. If you understand a problem—because you live with it—you can draft a solution. No credentials required. No institutional backing needed.

### The Result
Politicians get access to high-quality, non-captured policy alternatives. The institutional monopoly weakens. They can choose based on merit, not obligation.

**This is democratic infrastructure. Use it. Fork it. Build on it.**
