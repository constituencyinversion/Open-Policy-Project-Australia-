                <p><strong>Target:</strong> Federal Parliament of Australia</p>

            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            
            <div class="problem-box">
                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>Australia's current tax system creates fundamental unfairness by taxing people earning minimum wage—subsistence labour—while allowing significant tax minimisation through complex ownership structures and passive income arrangements.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Current Situation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Workers on minimum wage pay income tax despite earning only enough for basic subsistence</li>
                    <li>Tax-free threshold has not kept pace with wage growth, causing bracket creep</li>
                    <li>Discretionary trusts and complex structures enable substantial tax minimisation</li>
                    <li>Multinational profit shifting reduces Australia's tax base by billions annually</li>
                    <li>Passive income receives preferential treatment compared to labour income</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                <p>A <strong>Labour-First Tax System</strong> that exempts subsistence labour from taxation while recovering revenue through enhanced fiscal integrity measures targeting ownership structures and passive income.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Mechanisms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raise tax-free threshold to full-time minimum wage (automatically indexed)</li>
                    <li>Mandatory beneficial ownership transparency for discretionary trusts</li>
                    <li>Strengthen multinational profit attribution based on economic substance</li>
                    <li>Remove preferential treatment for passive income above subsistence levels</li>
                    <li>Maintain fiscal neutrality through targeted integrity measures</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-note">
                <h4>What This Does NOT Do</h4>
                <ul class="avoids-list">
                    <li>❌ Does NOT increase consumption taxes (GST)</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT reduce services or increase government debt</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT penalise genuine small businesses</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT affect retirement income protections</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT create new bureaucratic complexity for ordinary workers</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>This shifts the tax burden from labour to ownership, rent-seeking, and financial complexity.</strong></p>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            
            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Workers and Families</h4>
                <p>Workers earning minimum wage keep their full income without taxation—recognising that subsistence labour should not be taxed.</p>
                <p>Automatic indexation prevents bracket creep, protecting take-home pay over time.</p>
                <p>Reduces welfare dependency by making work more financially rewarding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Economic Fairness</h4>
                <p>Shifts tax burden from those who can least afford it (subsistence workers) to those with greater capacity to pay (ownership, passive income, complex structures).</p>
                <p>Closes loopholes that allow tax minimisation through discretionary trusts and income splitting.</p>
                <p>Ensures multinational corporations pay fair tax on Australian economic activity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Fiscal Integrity</h4>
                <p>Maintains revenue neutrality through targeted integrity measures.</p>
                <p>Enhanced transparency in beneficial ownership strengthens compliance.</p>
                <p>Independent oversight ensures ongoing effectiveness and fairness.</p>
                <p>No increase to GST, government debt, or reduction in services.</p>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Small Business</h4>
                <p>Safe-harbour provisions protect genuine small and family businesses from compliance penalties.</p>
                <p>Clear tests and graduated penalties encourage voluntary compliance.</p>
                <p>Targets artificial arrangements, not legitimate business structures.</p>
