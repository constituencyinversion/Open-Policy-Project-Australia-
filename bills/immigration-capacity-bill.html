            <div class="problem-box">
                <h4>The Structural Problem</h4>
                <p>Australia's immigration program currently operates without measurable capacity constraints, creating systemic pressures:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing Crisis:</strong> Immigration intake exceeds net housing supply, driving rental shortages and price inflation</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Strain:</strong> Hospital overcrowding and emergency department pressure from population growth exceeding service capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure Lag:</strong> Population growth outpaces water, energy, transport, and essential service provision</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Distortion:</strong> Migration-driven business activity obscures genuine economic performance and small business viability</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Substitution:</strong> Immigration used as substitute for skills investment, wage growth, and productivity improvements</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h4>The Capacity Framework Solution</h4>
                <p>This bill establishes a measurable, transparent framework that ties immigration intake to demonstrated national capacity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Core Mechanisms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>National Capacity Assessment Framework (hard and soft constraints)</li>
                    <li>Mandatory capacity indexing before annual intake determination</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure stress triggers (automatic reduction when capacity exceeded)</li>
                    <li>Economic alignment with sovereign productivity strategy</li>
                    <li>Transparent public reporting and independent audit</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>This is data-driven policy, not ideological restriction.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-note">
                <h4>What This Framework Does NOT Do</h4>
                <ul class="avoids-list">
                    <li>❌ Does NOT ban immigration</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT impose racial or ethnic quotas</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT target specific countries or religions</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT prevent economic migration</li>
                    <li>❌ Does NOT eliminate humanitarian pathways</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Part 1: Objects and Guiding Principles</h3>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Objects of the Act (Section 3)</h4>
                <p>Immigration must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operate within demonstrable national capacity</li>
                    <li>Protect housing, healthcare, infrastructure from unsustainable pressure</li>
                    <li>Align with sovereign and sustainable economic model</li>
                    <li>Preserve integrity of democratic and statistical systems</li>
                    <li>Reinforce civic obligations of permanent residence and citizenship</li>
                    <li>Include safeguards against violent extremism with rule of law protections</li>

            </div>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Guiding Principles (Section 4)</h4>
                
                <p><strong>1. Capacity Alignment:</strong> Immigration must not exceed capacity to provide housing, healthcare, infrastructure without displacing existing residents.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Economic Coherence:</strong> Immigration complements (not substitutes) sovereign economic strategy prioritizing productivity, skills, domestic industry.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Data Integrity:</strong> Immigration must not distort economic statistics or labor market signals used for democratic accountability.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Democratic Neutrality:</strong> Immigration and citizenship processes must not distort electoral outcomes within single electoral cycle.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5. Civic Reciprocity:</strong> Permanent residence and citizenship entail mutual obligations including respect for law and secular governance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>6. Security and Public Safety:</strong> Proportionate, lawful safeguards against violent extremism based on conduct and demonstrable risk.</p>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>National Capacity Assessment Framework (Section 7)</h4>
                <p><strong>Mandatory Indicators:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Net increase in habitable housing stock</li>
                    <li>National and regional rental vacancy rates</li>
                    <li>Public hospital bed availability and emergency department capacity</li>
                    <li>Availability of essential service workers (healthcare, education, emergency)</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure utilization (water, energy, transport)</li>

                <p><strong>Critical Requirement:</strong> Only demonstrated, current capacity may be relied upon. Projected or proposed infrastructure cannot be treated as available until operational.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Capacity-Indexed Immigration Intake (Section 8)</h4>
                <p>Before each financial year, Minister must determine maximum immigration intake consistent with Capacity Assessment Framework.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Hard Prohibition:</strong> Immigration intake must not exceed hard capacity constraints at national or regional level.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Regional Application:</strong> Where regional migration programs exist, capacity assessed at regional level, not inferred from national averages.</p>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Infrastructure Stress Trigger (Section 9)</h4>
                <p>When indicators demonstrate sustained infrastructure stress:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Housing shortages</li>
                    <li>Hospital overcrowding</li>
                    <li>Essential service workforce depletion</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Mandatory Response:</strong> Minister must suspend intake increases or reduce intake levels until capacity stabilizes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Suspension/reduction remains until updated assessments show restored capacity.</p>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Economic Alignment Requirement (Section 10)</h4>
                <p><strong>Sovereign Economic Alignment:</strong> Immigration must align with strategy prioritizing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Productivity growth</li>
                    <li>Skills development and domestic training pipelines</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Prohibition on Substitution:</strong> Immigration must not be used as substitute for domestic skills investment, wage growth, or structural economic reform.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="provision-card">
                <h4>Business and Investment Visa Integrity (Section 11)</h4>
                <p>Minister may impose caps on business/investment visas where evidence shows they're used primarily as migration vehicles rather than productive enterprises.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Market Distortion Test:</strong> Consider whether migration-linked business activity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distorts competition with domestic small businesses</li>
                    <li>Operates at sustained artificial losses inconsistent with viability</li>
                    <li>Obscures true business failure statistics</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Statistical Integrity:</strong> Businesses primarily established for migration qualification must be identified separately for statistical reporting.</p>

            <h3>Why Capacity Indexing Matters</h3>
            
            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Housing Affordability</h4>
                <p>Immigration intake tied to actual housing supply prevents population growth from exceeding shelter availability. Reduces rental shortages and price pressure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Healthcare Access</h4>
                <p>Population growth matched to hospital capacity prevents emergency department overcrowding and ensures healthcare accessibility for existing and new residents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Economic Integrity</h4>
                <p>Prevents immigration from being used as substitute for skills investment and wage growth. Aligns population growth with productivity improvements and per-capita prosperity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-box">
                <h4>For Democratic Transparency</h4>
                <p>Measurable capacity constraints, transparent reporting, and independent audit ensure immigration policy is data-driven and democratically accountable.</p>
